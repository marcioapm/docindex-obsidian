# Architecture

The codebase follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with clear separation of concerns. Currently, the architecture is a hybrid of DDD and Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters pattern), which is subject to ongoing refactoring.

## Directory Structure

```

├── adapter/              # External system adapters
│   ├── orama/           # Orama vector database integration

```

**Note on Architecture**: The current structure mixes DDD and Ports/Adapters patterns. This is not a strict requirement and is open to refactoring. Some inconsistencies exist (e.g., `adapter/orama` could be in `infrastructure`, `services/` is legacy code being phased out). Feel free to improve the structure when making changes.

## Core Domain Flow

1. **Note Processing**: When a note is opened/modified, it's chunked into smaller pieces using LangChain's text splitters
2. **Embedding Generation**: Chunks are processed through a Transformers.js model (runs in Web Worker for performance)
3. **Vector Storage**: Embeddings are stored in Orama vector database for fast similarity search
4. **Similar Note Finding**: When requested, performs vector search to find semantically similar notes
5. **UI Display**: Results shown in Obsidian's UI through React components

## Key Services and Their Responsibilities

### Domain Services
- **EmbeddingService** (`domain/service/EmbeddingService.ts`): Manages ML model loading and text embedding generation. Uses Web Workers to avoid blocking the main thread.
- **NoteChunkingService** (`domain/service/NoteChunkingService.ts`): Splits notes into manageable chunks for embedding. Handles content exclusion based on RegExp patterns.
- **SimilarNoteFinder** (`domain/service/SimilarNoteFinder.ts`): Orchestrates the process of finding similar notes using vector search.

### Application Services
- **NoteIndexingService** (`application/NoteIndexingService.ts`): Manages background indexing of notes with progress tracking.
- **SettingsService** (`application/SettingsService.ts`): Handles plugin settings management and persistence.
- **SimilarNoteCoordinator** (`application/SimilarNoteCoordinator.ts`): Coordinates similar note finding and UI updates.
- **LeafViewCoordinator** (`application/LeafViewCoordinator.ts`): Manages Obsidian leaf views and bottom panel display.

### Infrastructure
- **VaultNoteRepository** (`infrastructure/VaultNoteRepository.ts`): Implementation of NoteRepository for Obsidian vault.
- **OramaNoteChunkRepository** (`adapter/orama/OramaNoteChunkRepository.ts`): Vector database implementation using Orama.
- **IndexedNoteMTimeStore** (`infrastructure/IndexedNoteMTimeStore.ts`): Tracks file modification times for incremental indexing.

## Important Implementation Details

1. **Web Workers**: Embedding generation runs in workers to prevent UI freezing. Worker code is in `src/adapter/worker/`.

2. **Model Loading**: ML models are downloaded from Hugging Face on first use. Two models available:
   - Default: `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (English-optimized)
   - Multilingual: `Xenova/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`

3. **Vector Database**: Orama is used for vector storage and search. Database is persisted and reloaded between sessions.

4. **Settings Storage**: Plugin settings are stored in Obsidian's data.json. UI for settings uses React components.

5. **Content Exclusion**: Supports RegExp patterns to exclude content from indexing (e.g., frontmatter, code blocks).

6. **Command Palette**: Commands are implemented in `src/commands/` with a extensible structure for easy addition of new commands.
